> Participants should always be informed of being recorded. Please remember to ask them before the meeting or at the beginning of the meeting.
> - You can attach in the calendar invite: "This meeting will be recorded using GDPR-compliant AI tools for note-taking purposes. We can share the recording and summaries with you for your review. If you do not wish to be recorded, please let us know."
> - Or you can ask this when the meeting starts: "Is it okay if I record this meeting using GDPR-compliant AI tools for note-taking purposes?"
